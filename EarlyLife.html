  <p><i style="font-size:25px;"> In the year 1856, a Serbian family in the Croatian village of Smiljan welcomed Nikola Tesla into the world. His younger brother's passing, a tense relationship with his parents, and a debilitating illness at age 12 all had a negative impact on his youth. Despite his own brilliance, Tesla was liked for his capacity to discern skill in others and to give them credit. When Tesla told Mark Twain that reading Twain's writings rescued him during his illness as a boy, Twain was so moved that he started crying, according to Tesla's memoirs. Early on, Tesla shown wisdom and drive. "After seeing a rendering or image of Niagara Falls, Tesla told his uncle Josip that he would one day erect aenormous wheel beneath the falls and therefore harness it," argues Seifer. In reality, Tesla would eventually use Niagara Falls' energy. Tesla studied physics and other subjects at the Polytechnic School in Graz, which is south of Vienna, after finishing the equivalent of high school and evading forced participation in a protracted war, however he did not stay to complete his degree. Later, he enrolled at the University of Prague, where he worked with Professor Ernst Mach to further his understanding of wave mechanics (and, indirectly, AC).In 1884, Tesla went to America after working in Paris. Tesla spent less than a year working in Thomas Edison's lab, frequently corresponding with the well-known American inventor. Nikola left Edison underpaid and unable to fulfill his more ambitious goals, despite the fact that he improved and designed numerous new devices for Edison. After learning that Nikola Tesla demanded a raise from $18 to $25 per week, Edison business manager Charles Batchelor remarked, "No, the woods are full of men like [Tesla], I can recruit any number of them for $18 a week.

Tesla marketed his motor concept shortly after quitting his position with Edison and discovered George Westinghouse to be a potential investor. WhileEdison had championed DC power, Tesla, with Westinghouse’s backing, had a different idea. According to a U.S. Department of Energy history, "Edison created direct current, current that runs continuously in a single direction, such in a battery or a fuel cell." Direct current, sometimes referred to as DC, was the norm in the United States throughout the early years of electricity. However, there was one issue. It is difficult to convert direct current to higher or lower voltages. Alternating current, also known as AC, was, in Tesla's opinion, the answer to this issue. Alternating current can be changed to different voltages with a transformer, and it reverses direction 60 times per second in the United States.

The National Electrical Exposition, held in Philadelphia in May 1895, was attended by Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and Alexander Graham Bell. Contrary to common belief, Edison did not behave like a ruthless businessman when Tesla's laboratory was destroyed by fire in March 1895. Instead, Edison gave Tesla a place to work. Furthermore, Edison generously said, "The most remarkable item at this exposition is the demonstration [by Tesla] of the ability to bring here an electric current generated at Niagara Falls," in Seifer's account of the Philadelphia exhibition. It, in my opinion, resolves one of themost important questions associated with electrical development.”</i></p>
