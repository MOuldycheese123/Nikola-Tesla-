  <article style="font-size: 60px;"> Nikola Tesla's inventions</h1>
    <body style="background-color:peachpuff">
<p><i style="font-size:25px;">Throughout his life, Nikola Tesla made a number of technological advancements. The 1856 birth of the math and physics prodigy in Smiljan, Croatia, resulted in innovations that still have an impact on our daily lives. He possessed more than 300 patents, but only a few of them were acknowledged, indicating that many of his ideas were tried and failed or were never widely known.

After earning degrees in philosophy from the University of Prague and technical engineering from the Technical University of Graz, he started sketching out his idea for an electromagnetic motor in 1882. His immigration to the United States in 1884 was prompted by his first work, which involved selling DC power plants for ConEd. Some of his fammous inventions include:</i></p>
    <ul style="font-size: 50px;">
     <li> AC Power (alternating current)</li>
<li>Tesla Coil</li>
<li>Magnifying Transmitter</li>
<li>Tesla Turbine</li>
<li>Shadowgraph</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Neon Lamp</li>
<li>Hydroelectric Power</li>
<li>Induction Motor</li>
<li>Radio Controlled Boat</li>
    </ul>
    <article style="font-size: 60px;"> Alternating Current Power</h1>
      <p><i style="font-size:25px;">When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current method successful.As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his next endeavor.

He applied for many patents for his AC power discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio and television transmission.

      <article style="font-size: 60px;">Tesla coil</article>
      <p><i style="font-size:25px;"> The Tesla coil, represented by the tower built at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, which is now the final existing laboratory and is located in Shoreham, New York, may be the most well-known representation of Tesla's work.
 Here, Tesla built a tower with his iconic coils on top, which fired electric sparks into the air and used alternating current to move the electricity around the coils.</i></p>          
       <article style="font-size: 60px;">Magnifying Transmitter</article>
       <p><i style="font-size:25px;">Tesla aimed to provide wireless power for free to everyone by using resonance to transport information from one tower to another, building on the discoveries of the Tesla coil. Lightning eventually erupted from one tower to the next as the currents were transmitted from one circuit to the next and increased in frequency.
         He gave his lab wireless electricity by attaching a wire to the tower and routing it all around it. He used light bulbs that weren't attached to any power source to show the effect to audiences on stage. An electrical current was successfully sent a kilometer afar by the magnifying transmitter.</i></p>
      <article style="font-size: 60px;">Tesla turbine</article>
      <p><i style="font-size:25px;">Tesla developed a piston engine to power automobiles using combustion to rotate disks.  At the time, commonly used turbines were less efficient and relied on blades. Tesla’s invention merged many disks to create a centrifugal pump.By moving fluid in the path of least resistance, his turbine was more fuel-efficient. His turbine is also known as “…the boundary-layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.</i></p>
      <article style="font-size: 60px;">Shadow graph</article>
      <p><i style="font-size:25px;">The Shadowgraph is another name for x-rays, but Tesla’s term is actually more depictive of the process. An x-ray creates a silhouette of the area captured by passing radioactive waves through the human body. Although the invention was initially developed by Rontgen, Tesla made improvements to the technique to render clearer images.</i></p>
      <article style="font-size: 60px;">Radio</article>
      <p><i style="font-size:25px;">Before his lab burned down, Tesla was working on developing a radio intended to transmit a signal fifty miles. Prior to its completion, however, another gentleman received a patent for a similar radio design in England.  Had he succeeded, Nikola Tesla’s invention would have surpassed the Brit’s invention in strength.</i></p>
